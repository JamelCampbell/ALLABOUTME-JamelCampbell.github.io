                            I am very creative in playing the drums. I am self-taught from an early age of about 6 years old. 
                            This strength I have deliberately tried to develop by becoming a part of my high school’s band. 
                            This strength is now fully developed as I now play the drums on a weekly basis as the main drummer 
                            at church and play at a number of church events such as rallies, concerts and conventions and conferences. 
                            I occasionally assist young people to develop their drumming skills by teaching them to play the drums.

                        I consider myself a very trustworthy person. I currently have developed some very strong bonds with a number 
                        of my primary schoolmates and have built some solid friendships with a number of my high school mates, community 
                        mates as well as in my church community. These strong bonds of friendship have lasted over the years because of 
                        how dependable and authentic I have proven myself to be. My friends know that their secrets are safe with me. 
                        I endeavour to be a true friend to a number of my associates by ensuring that I remain dependable and reliable 
                        as I have known to be over the years.

                        I am a very humble person who shows much care and compassion for the people in my circle. I am an excellent team 
                        player who listens to people around me and is always ready to help and show empathy where needed. In high school, 
                        my leadership skills were evident and as such, I was made prefect during my senior years I was also a part of the 
                        Student’s Council Executive body. To maintain or continue the development of these leadership skills I try to attend 
                        any available sessions dealing with leadership training for example at Church

                    <p> 
                        Chapters 4 – 7 of the book entitled <i>“Twelve Pillars”</i> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener (pp. 43 – 80) speak about two friends that decided to meet up after not seeing each other for a while. 
                        They sat and talked about life for a bit until the conversation strayed with Charlie asking Michael what his goals for his career are. Michael was undecided about his goals so Charlie, 
                        being older and more experienced, gave the much younger Michael advice. He encouraged Michael to write his goals down as writing them brings them into reality. Success doesn’t come in 
                        the wink of an eye so he would have to start by changing his direction and charting a path to get there. Along this journey, we can suffer from one of two pains, the pain of regret or 
                        the pain of discipline. The difference is that regret weighs tons while discipline weighs ounces. If you don’t achieve your goals during your lifetime you will suffer from the crushing 
                        weight of regret. The best opportunities are aligned with your overall goals and should be what most of your time is spent on. So, time management is very important. Either you control 
                        your time, or it will control you. Surrounding yourself with successful and influential people is another way to achieve your goals. Persons who are winners and who are successful can 
                        have a long-lasting effect on those around them. When we associate ourselves with them does it help us to grow and inspire us to pursue our goals with a greater passion? Yes, it does. 
                        Every relationship we have is an association and each association has either a positive or negative effect on us. To achieve success, we must constantly determine what kind of relationship 
                        you want with people. Success in life is also not determined by formal education but the key is self-education. Self-education is what you teach, yourself this allows for constant improvement 
                        and growth. There are a few mainstays to learning that anyone can use to improve their lives. The first is to read books, the second is to learn from successful people by observation and lastly 
                        by reflecting on personal experiences. Books are considered one of the greatest learning tools in human history. When we read them, they open our minds to new ideas, which are seeds that grow; 
                        when they grow, they become our achievements and successes.<br>
                        After reading Chapters 4 – 7 of the book entitled <i>“Twelve Pillars”</i>, it is extremely evident that if I wish to be successful in life there are some definite steps I must take. Most importantly I 
                        must set goals that I wish to achieve and make plans and take all necessary steps to achieve them. These include documenting such goals, and surrounding myself with like-minded and successful 
                        individuals. It is important not to procrastinate but to spend quality time on the things that are important. I understand that I must be a lifelong learner which is to learn as I go and grow 
                        and use the experiences to constantly improve. I must endeavour to read books and observe successful people while I constantly reflect on my own experiences and learn what went wrong and went 
                        right.
